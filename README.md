##Complexity Analysis

Data structure and Algorithms is the foundation for coding problems

Complexity analysis is the backbone of interview problems

Are all solutions equal? Performance?

No all solutions are not equal, some implementations are better than others

Ways to analyze are time (duration of execution) and space (amount of memory used )

######Time - how fast can your program run
 
######Space - extra amount of memory they require to execute

How to define good code?
- runs fast
- less memory
- readability
- does what it's meant to do

2 main factors to define good code base 

Readability - can developer understand the code at glance, simple enough to interpret

Scalability - is the code scalable or not (speed and space), 
application can only be scaled if it is fast and uses less memory

Scalability
-- Time complexity
    Amount of time it takes to run an algorithm
    Faster the algorithm runs, better time complexity
     
-- Space complexity (Memory)
    Amount of extra space algorithm requires
    Lesser space algorithm takes, better space complexity
    
#Big O Notation
Big O is used to give a rating for code base. 
Describes performance or complexity of an algorithm
Used to measure time and space complexity of code base


how to judge implementation execution time
how to judge memory or space used (in memory or on disk) by algorithm

To measure the efficiency of an algorithm we need to consider time complexity and space complexity
Time Complexity: how much time does it take to run completely?c
Space Complexity: how much extra space does it require in the process?

Big O ratings
Excellent 
Good 
Fair
Bad 
Horrible


# Key takeaways
  Don't calculate time in minutes or seconds (only use for test and dev not prod)
  System clock is not dependable because different machines can give different results
  evaluating speed with timestamp depends on hardware, ram etc.
  Can't depend on system clock nor hardware because of to many variables
  
  Big O gives performance rating to our program for time and space
  Doesn't depend on time
  depends on how many steps the program is performing
  Focus is to calculate the amount of work we do or the number of comparisons we perform
  
  Big O Notation is the language used to describe how long an algorithm or function takes to run
  depends on actual code and operation

  Space complexity of an algorithm represents the amount of extra 
  memory space needed by the algorithm in its life cycle

  We usually have 2 types of space requirements:
    1. To store our input data 
    2. Extra space necessary to execute the program

  How much additional memory do we need to allocate in order to
  run our code
